    "\n",
    "**Hint 1:** The prior probabilities for a Naive Bayes classifier can be specified using the `class_prior` option. You will have to provide the probabilities in the same order as the alphabetically sorted class (entity) names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2:** To tune the performance of your method, you can try to tweak the behaviour of the vectorizer (for example, should it apply lowercasing or not?) and the width of the window from which you are extracting context tokens at prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 3:** Not all mentions in the knowledge base are ambiguous, and therefore not all mentions have context data. If a mention has only one possible entity, pick that one. If a mention has no entity at all, predict the `--NME--` label."
